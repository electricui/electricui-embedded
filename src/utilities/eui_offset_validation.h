/**
 * @brief Calculates valid start and end address offsets for multi-packet transfers
 *
 * Start and endpoints are sent in a metadata message so the receiver knows the overall shape of the offset structure.
 * The startpoint/endpoint of the slice are type-aware, and will ensure that any standard types aren't split across packets.
 * The returned offsets are used when sending the stream of partial-payload packets. 
 *
 * @warning As TYPE_CUSTOM layouts are out of the library's control, there are no guarantees about splitting custom structures correctly.
 *
 * @param base User-specified starting address of the desired slice
 * @param offset User-specified end address of the desired slice
 * @param type_bytes Type of data being sliced
 * @param size Total size of the payload being sliced
 * @param start Pointer to the destination of the start offset value
 * @param end Pointer to the destination of the start offset value
